# The Little Schemer

Running through [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition) to learn me a LISP!

Each chapter will have it's own individual file.

I'm using [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/) and the flag `#lang scheme`
[(although the differences between racket and scheme are scant)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3358638)
